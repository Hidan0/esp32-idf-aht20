# esp32-idf-aht20: Temperature and humidity monitoring with AHT20 and esp-rs

This is a small demo project that demonstrates how to use the AHT20 sensor and an ESP32 to monitor temperature and humidity.

The project is written in Rust and provides a simple example of how to interface with the AHT20 sensor and how to communicate with it using the [AHT20](https://crates.io/crates/aht20) crate.
